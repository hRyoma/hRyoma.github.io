                    <p>The senior project is a long-term project that begins in the junior year of high school. Students
                        choose and research an area of interest and reach out to potential mentors. They then complete
                        70 hours of professional work, which culminates in a final product.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For my senior project, I reached out to Dr. Padilla, a research assistant at Old Dominion
                        University's Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center (VMASC).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the course of four weeks, I interned at VMASC, working on a project related to ODU's
                        simulation software called CLOUDES. In order to make such software more accessible, I was tasked
                        to design a physical complement to the web service so that it can be used by the
                        visually-impaired. Additionally, I was tasked to begin developing software that would enable the
                        physical pieces to be translated into a digital form via computer vision.</p>

                    <p>I found that there were many functions in Python of which I was unaware. Also, by reading the
                        official documentations, I was able to get a deeper understanding of the topics that I already
                        knew. I am sure that these will be helpful later on my senior project, or in the least, in
                        future projects.</p>

                    <p>I did not find the general information on AI very surprising. However, after reading Alan
                        Turing's 22 page paper was quite interesting, especially as he discusses modern computer science
                        topics in 1950. Much of his paper dealt with counterarguments and refutes. However, some of his
                        core ideas may be worth reviewing later on, as these are still fundamental ideas today.</p>

                    <p>After studying computer vision further, I found that there are many layers to it. I find that
                        there is a lot of linear algebra nested in this field. This may be a good area to research
                        further if I want to dive into the low level aspect of the code. Perhaps rather than using CV in
                        a future research project, I can instead research an aspect of CV.</p>

                    <p>OpenCV is an open-source software library. It is written in C/C++, but there is a Python wrapper
                        version available for use. To get a better sense of it before beginning to program, I will
                        explore its core functionalities.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>There were many more image transformation functions than I expected. I think that I understand
                        the concepts of kernels and Gaussian distributions, but I may need to review this once again.
                        Overall, I think that this information that I researched will be very valuable as I now have a
                        better understanding of the purpose of each type of function and the methods used for curating
                        images.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Also, I discovered from this that linear algebra is even more prevalent in CV. The two types of
                        image gradients (Sobel/Scharr derivatives and Laplachain derivatives), I did not understand. I
                        have a vague idea of how it works, but I could not discern the math behind it. I do not think
                        that this knowledge is necessary for this internship, but this opens another avenue for further
                        research.</p>

                        <h4>Final Report: Developing a Physical Complement to the CLOUDES Web Service for the Visually
                            Impaired</h4>
                    </div>
                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the past decade, the Internet has made countless services available to millions of people.
                        However, this virtual world remains largely inaccessible to the visually impaired, those who
                        have a functionally limited eyesight as a consequence of a disease or disorder[1].</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One such service is CLOUDES, a web service for creating simulations. Its visual-based interface
                        makes it user-friendly, promoting use by non-professionals and students. In order to make it
                        accessible to the visually impaired, physical representations of the digital interface were
                        explored. Tactile components would enable the visually impaired to create a physical model,
                        which can be translated into the CLOUDES web service via computer vision processing of the
                        image.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Discussion</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>In CLOUDES, several different types of elements can be added to the simulation model such as
                        Arrival, Queue, Process, and Exit. The user can then connect each element together to create the
                        correct sequence of the procedure. The physical model sought to maintain this through unique
                        pieces for each element, which can be put together like a puzzle. A previous design used
                        circular-shaped tabs to connect pieces, which allowed flexibility in motion. However, a
                        trapezoidal shape was used to preserve the rigid uniformity in the constructed model.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As each element in the CLOUDES software could be parameterized, characterizing the behavior
                        of each step in the process, chips were designed to be placed onto each piece. Each piece had a
                        unique shape corresponding to its function: hexagons corresponded to distribution specifiers,
                        triangles corresponded to actions, etc. Simple geometric shapes were used for the chips as a
                        study done by researchers from the Transworld Institute of Technology in Taiwan had found
                        them to be more easily identified than complex icons by touch[2]. Each chip also had a unique
                        embossing of a letter or number to further specify its function. A braille alternative was
                        developed as well. Engravings were originally considered but opted against as most prints use
                        embossing, making it more familiar to the visually impaired.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To further assist in braille recognition, standard braille dimensions from the National Library
                        Service for the Blind and Physically Handicappped were observed[3]. The final design used sizes
                        which scaled to be 1.5 times larger than standard to enhance computer vision performance and to
                        maintain relative distances between dots. The dot diameter was increased from 1.6 mm to 2.4
                        mm and dot base spacing was increased to 3.6 mm. However, to prevent potentially rough
                        braille, the dot height remained unscaled at 0.9 mm. Additionally, these dots were made of
                        hemispheres rather than cylinders to also reduce roughness.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The physical design was also flat to reduce as much use of materials. It also had rounded corners
                        to be more gentle to the touch.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To enable a computer to recognize the pieces and chips from an image, OpenCV, an open source
                        package with tools for real-time computer vision, was explored. The idea was to identify each
                        piece of the model using its unique shape and color, then to identify each chip and its
                        corresponding braille or character embossing. This data could then be converted into the
                        CLOUDES web service to run the simulation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A morphological transformation on the image best created the outline of the shapes. However,
                        due to little contrast in color between the embossings and the chips itself, it was challenging
                        to highlight the key features of the model. Additionally, the wood grains of the desk in the
                        background and even the layers of 3D-printed material added to noise to the image.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although character recognition is widely accessible, braille recognition remains somewhat
                        unexplored. A paper from King Saud University outlines the image transformation steps that has
                        yielded a more efficient recognition of braille cells[4]. The process involves first rotating
                        the image to align the braille vertically and horizontally, detecting each dot, and then
                        recognizing each cell. Each cell could be identified by segmenting then constructing lines in
                        regular intervals according to a scale. The intersection of the dots and lines allow
                        identification of each cell.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Identifying each braille character requires another process. In a paper from the Proceedings of
                        the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, such a system of optical recognition
                        was proposed[5]. It would identify each column of braille dots, also known as as a half
                        character. Though the paper recognizes room for further optimization, it claims that the current
                        system achieves a 99% accuracy rate in recognition.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Though not used in the testing samples, the final physical model should use different colors for
                        each set of pieces and chips to enhance recognition accuracy by computer vision. Furthermore,
                        as the pieces were constructed from a combination of geometric shapes, pictures of the pieces
                        need to be taken under different conditions to create a dataset train the program to recognize
                        each one.</p>

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>8:00 AM. Today, I began my first day of the internship listening to a discussion of a future
                        project. I got to see firsthand how professionals communicate and exchange ideas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Afterwards, I began working on my first project. There is an online service called CLOUDES where
                        users are able to create simulations of processes using the queuing paradigm. However, as it is
                        all visual-based, it is not readily accessible to the visually impaired. So, I familiarized
                        myself with the application and brainstormed ways to create this physically using a 3D-printer.
                        This design needs to be recognizable to the visually impaired and the computer, which will
                        utilize computer vision (CV) to translate it into a digital simulation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This task presents many layers of complexities. The design needs to be both functional and
                        aesthetic. It needs to be large enough to be recognizable by the computer while also being
                        compact. The task seemed straight forward at first, but formulating a solution that adheres to
                        the constraints seem quite difficult.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The following day, I continued designing. I created a PowerPoint presentation that showcases each
                        piece and my thought-process for designing it in that way. I presented it to my mentor, Dr.
                        Padilla, as well as another faculty member, on Friday.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I had gotten more accustomed to presenting in school, but this was a unique experience. Some
                        constructive criticism included introducing the problem and solution at the beginning of my
                        presentation, rather than diving into the solution. Another critique was to support design
                        choices with research literature.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While working on this project, I got to observe a presentation by a fourth-year student on
                        insider threats in corporations. While this does not pertain to my projects, it still offered
                        interesting perspectives in cybersecurity and corporate ethics.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>I made good progress on the brainstorming and development of the designs. The informal
                        presentation was still a little bit nerve wracking, but I thought that my presentation skills
                        were adequate. There are definitely room for improvement (starting with a story of a problem,
                        adding references on the slides, etc.), however.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My next steps are to bring these ideas to life by designing it on 3D modeling software, then
                        printing it. Throughout, I will probably have to research a little more and revise the
                        dimensions.</p>

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>I further refined my designs and came up with dimensions for each piece. On Monday, I began
                        playing with another web application called Sketchup, where I will be building the 3D models. By
                        the end of Wednesday, I had completed most of the pieces. I had great difficulty creating the
                        braille for the number chips. I continued to tackle this problem the next day. Eventually, I
                        found that I could just import a component from the web.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I came on Thursday instead this week to meet Dr. Garcia, who gave me a tutorial on using their
                        3D-printer. I did a test print with one of my designed pieces and found that the chips were
                        slightly too big for the slots in the pieces. So, I fixed that before setting up a print
                        overnight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally printing the pieces really refreshed my motivation. Also, Dr. Padilla asked me to see
                        another professional after this summer internship to present my design. In addition, he asked me
                        if I would be willing to be a lead in publishing a paper on this project to present at a
                        conference at George Mason University sometime next year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>I think that I made good progress once again this week. Getting a successful print turn out as
                        well as I thought it would felt very rewarding. I hope that next week, I will be able to print
                        and test more pieces so that I can soon get started on the OpenCV program.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In regards to the research paper and conference, I think that it will be an awesome experience
                        that will have a lot to offer. At this time, however, I am a little anxious about the work and
                        time
                        that would require, especially as I head into senior year and do college applications. This is
                        a path I will definitely consider to further extend my senior project.</p>

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I arrived at VMASC on Monday, the second test print had failed. I emailed Dr. Garcia to see
                        if he will be available to assist in troubleshooting. It seemed to me that the nozzle was
                        clogged. Upon disassembly of the nozzle, we found a small piece of filament stuck inside. My
                        mentor and I tried to troubleshoot the problem as Dr. Garcia was busy, but we ultimately could
                        not fix the issue.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For each chip, I resolved to have one set of braille and second set of alphabet to identify each
                        specification. At this point, I found that the rhombus-shaped chips were too small to contain
                        some of the letters, so I slightly enlarged it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On Wednesday and Friday, I explored alternate options for the design. An idea that I adapted from
                        Dr. Padilla was to use voice-recognition to add parameters. I also watched tutorial videos to
                        learn how to use OpenCV for Python.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>I felt that this week's progress was a little slow. There was not much I could do with so many
                        issues with the 3D printer. I tried spend my time proactively by visualizing possible faults in
                        my current designs and revising it, but it would have been a lot quicker to be able to get
                        started with the programming this week. For now, I can only study OpenCV further and brainstorm
                        an outline code for the software.</p>

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>This week, I started and worked on completing the computer vision aspect of the project. I met
                        with someone named Chance, who was familiar with OpenCV. He gave me some guidance to get me
                        going in the right direction. Chance also advised me to learn the basics of computer science, at
                        the low-level, in order to be able to break through the abstraction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After creating an outline of the program, I began working on Repl.it. My major task was to
                        transform the image using various functions so that I could get its outlines. This was very
                        challenging. The wood grains of the desk in the background at first added noise. Additionally,
                        the 3D-printed material itself had visible traces of the printer filament, further adding
                        noise. Also, the illumination proved to be problematic, as some parts of the picture were more
                        lit up than others.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was able to successfully print a new batch. Before my last day, I used a much larger
                        3D-printer to get myself a batch to take home, so that I could continue work on the program for
                        the next month or two. As Dr. Garcia was busy, I was given the tutorial from a friendly
                        gentleman named John.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To conclude my internship, I was tasked to write up a two-page report summarizing the design
                        choices and the research behind it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>This week was much more productive than last week. I even got to work the industrial-size
                        3D-printer, which was awesome. I wished that I could make more progress on the program itself,
                        but it was challenging to transform the image in a way that its features were
                        distinguishable. The work feels incomplete, but overall, I made significant progress on it in
                        four-weeks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All-in-all, this experience was very rewarding. Everyone at VMASC was very friendly and
                        knowledgeable. I was able to perform some academic research while refining my professionalism. I
                        found that there is much for me to still learn and I am excited to pursue my exploration of the
                        computer science field.</p>
