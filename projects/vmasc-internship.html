            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>During the spring of my junior year in high school, I reached out to Dr. Padilla, a research assistant at Old Dominion University's Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center (VMASC).</p>
            <p>Over the course of four weeks, I interned at VMASC, working on a project related to ODU's simulation software called CLOUDES. In order to make such software more accessible, I was tasked to design a physical complement to the web service so that it can be used by the visually-impaired. Additionally, I was tasked to begin developing software that would enable the physical pieces to be translated into a digital form via computer vision.</p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>8:00 AM. Today, I began my first day of the internship listening to a discussion of a future project. I got to see firsthand how professionals communicate and exchange ideas.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, I began working on my first project. There is an online service called CLOUDES where users are able to create simulations of processes using the queuing paradigm. However, as it is all visual-based, it is not readily accessible to the visually impaired. So, I familiarized myself with the application and brainstormed ways to create this physically using a 3D-printer. This design needs to be recognizable to the visually impaired and the computer, which will utilize computer vision (CV) to translate it into a digital simulation.</p>
            <p>This task presents many layers of complexities. The design needs to be both functional and aesthetic. It needs to be large enough to be recognizable by the computer while also being compact. The task seemed straight forward at first, but formulating a solution that adheres to the constraints seem quite difficult.</p>
            <p>The following day, I continued designing. I created a PowerPoint presentation that showcases each piece and my thought-process for designing it in that way. I presented it to my mentor, Dr. Padilla, as well as another faculty member, on Friday.</p>
            <p>I had gotten more accustomed to presenting in school, but this was a unique experience. Some constructive criticism included introducing the problem and solution at the beginning of my presentation, rather than diving into the solution. Another critique was to support design choices with research literature.</p>
            <p>While working on this project, I got to observe a presentation by a fourth-year student on insider threats in corporations. While this does not pertain to my projects, it still offered interesting perspectives in cybersecurity and corporate ethics.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>I made good progress on the brainstorming and development of the designs. The informal presentation was still a little bit nerve wracking, but I thought that my presentation skills were adequate. There are definitely room for improvement (starting with a story of a problem, adding references on the slides, etc.), however.</p>
            <p>My next steps are to bring these ideas to life by designing it on 3D modeling software, then printing it. Throughout, I will probably have to research a little more and revise the dimensions.</p>

            <h3 id="week-2">Week 2 - August 12th to 16th</h3>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p><u>General Information</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mentor observation</li>
                <li>Independent work</li>
                <li>8 hours (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Tasks</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Refining of designs</li>
                <li>3D development in Sketchup</li>
                <li>Research into design specifics and braille</li>
                <li>3D printer tutorial and printing</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>I further refined my designs and came up with dimensions for each piece. On Monday, I began playing with another web application called Sketchup, where I will be building the 3D models. By the end of Wednesday, I had completed most of the pieces. I had great difficulty creating the braille for the number chips. I continued to tackle this problem the next day. Eventually, I found that I could just import a component from the web.</p>
            <p>I came on Thursday instead this week to meet Dr. Garcia, who gave me a tutorial on using their 3D-printer. I did a test print with one of my designed pieces and found that the chips were slightly too big for the slots in the pieces. So, I fixed that before setting up a print overnight.</p>
            <p>Finally printing the pieces really refreshed my motivation. Also, Dr. Padilla asked me to see
                another professional after this summer internship to present my design. In addition, he asked me
                if I would be willing to be a lead in publishing a paper on this project to present at a
                conference at George Mason University sometime next year.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>I think that I made good progress once again this week. Getting a successful print turn out as well as I thought it would felt very rewarding. I hope that next week, I will be able to print and test more pieces so that I can soon get started on the OpenCV program.</p>
            <p>In regards to the research paper and conference, I think that it will be an awesome experience that will have a lot to offer. At this time, however, I am a little anxious about the work and time that would require, especially as I head into senior year and do college applications. This is a path I will definitely consider to further extend my senior project.</p>

            <h3 id="week-3">Week 3 - August 19th to 23rd</h3>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p><u>General Information</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mentor observation</li>
                <li>Independent work</li>
                <li>8 hours (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Tasks</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>3D printing and troubleshooting</li>
                <li>Design revisions on Sketchup</li>
                <li>Brainstorming of designs</li>
                <li>Independent study on OpenCV</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>When I arrived at VMASC on Monday, the second test print had failed. I emailed Dr. Garcia to see if he will be available to assist in troubleshooting. It seemed to me that the nozzle was clogged. Upon disassembly of the nozzle, we found a small piece of filament stuck inside. My mentor and I tried to troubleshoot the problem as Dr. Garcia was busy, but we ultimately could not fix the issue.</p>
            <p>For each chip, I resolved to have one set of braille and second set of alphabet to identify each specification. At this point, I found that the rhombus-shaped chips were too small to contain some of the letters, so I slightly enlarged it.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday and Friday, I explored alternate options for the design. An idea that I adapted from Dr. Padilla was to use voice-recognition to add parameters. I also watched tutorial videos to learn how to use OpenCV for Python.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>I felt that this week's progress was a little slow. There was not much I could do with so many issues with the 3D printer. I tried spend my time proactively by visualizing possible faults in my current designs and revising it, but it would have been a lot quicker to be able to get started with the programming this week. For now, I can only study OpenCV further and brainstorm an outline code for the software.</p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This week, I started and worked on completing the computer vision aspect of the project. I met with someone named Chance, who was familiar with OpenCV. He gave me some guidance to get me going in the right direction. Chance also advised me to learn the basics of computer science, at the low-level, in order to be able to break through the abstraction.</p>
            <p>After creating an outline of the program, I began working on Repl.it. My major task was to transform the image using various functions so that I could get its outlines. This was very challenging. The wood grains of the desk in the background at first added noise. Additionally, the 3D-printed material itself had visible traces of the printer filament, further adding noise. Also, the illumination proved to be problematic, as some parts of the picture were more
            <p>I was able to successfully print a new batch. Before my last day, I used a much larger 3D-printer to get myself a batch to take home, so that I could continue work on the program for the next month or two. As Dr. Garcia was busy, I was given the tutorial from a friendly gentleman named John.</p>
            <p>To conclude my internship, I was tasked to write up a two-page report summarizing the design choices and the research behind it.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>This week was much more productive than last week. I even got to work the industrial-size 3D-printer, which was awesome. I wished that I could make more progress on the program itself, but it was challenging to transform the image in a way that its features were distinguishable. The work feels incomplete, but overall, I made significant progress on it in four-weeks.</p>
            <p>All-in-all, this experience was very rewarding. Everyone at VMASC was very friendly and knowledgeable. I was able to perform some academic research while refining my professionalism. I found that there is much for me to still learn and I am excited to pursue my exploration of the computer science field.</p>

            <h3>Developing a Physical Complement to the CLOUDES Web Service for the Visually Impaired</h3>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>Over the past decade, the Internet has made countless services available to millions of people. However, this virtual world remains largely inaccessible to the visually impaired, those who have a functionally limited eyesight as a consequence of a disease or disorder[1].</p>
            <p>One such service is CLOUDES, a web service for creating simulations. Its visual-based interface makes it user-friendly, promoting use by non-professionals and students. In order to make it accessible to the visually impaired, physical representations of the digital interface were explored. Tactile components would enable the visually impaired to create a physical model, which can be translated into the CLOUDES web service via computer vision processing of the image.</p>

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>In CLOUDES, several different types of elements can be added to the simulation model such as Arrival, Queue, Process, and Exit. The user can then connect each element together to create the correct sequence of the procedure. The physical model sought to maintain this through unique pieces for each element, which can be put together like a puzzle. A previous design used circular-shaped tabs to connect pieces, which allowed flexibility in motion. However, a trapezoidal shape was used to preserve the rigid uniformity in the constructed model.</p>
            <p>As each element in the CLOUDES software could be parameterized, characterizing the behavior of each step in the process, chips were designed to be placed onto each piece. Each piece had a unique shape corresponding to its function: hexagons corresponded to distribution specifiers, triangles corresponded to actions, etc. Simple geometric shapes were used for the chips as a study done by researchers from the Transworld Institute of Technology in Taiwan had found them to be more easily identified than complex icons by touch[2]. Each chip also had a unique embossing of a letter or number to further specify its function. A braille alternative was developed as well. Engravings were originally considered but opted against as most prints use embossing, making it more familiar to the visually impaired.</p>
            <p>To further assist in braille recognition, standard braille dimensions from the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicappped were observed[3]. The final design used sizes which scaled to be 1.5 times larger than standard to enhance computer vision performance and to maintain relative distances between dots. The dot diameter was increased from 1.6 mm to 2.4 mm and dot base spacing was increased to 3.6 mm. However, to prevent potentially rough braille, the dot height remained unscaled at 0.9 mm. Additionally, these dots were made of hemispheres rather than cylinders to also reduce roughness.</p>
            <p>The physical design was also flat to reduce as much use of materials. It also had rounded corners to be more gentle to the touch.</p>
            <p>To enable a computer to recognize the pieces and chips from an image, OpenCV, an open source package with tools for real-time computer vision, was explored. The idea was to identify each piece of the model using its unique shape and color, then to identify each chip and its corresponding braille or character embossing. This data could then be converted into the CLOUDES web service to run the simulation.</p>
            <p>A morphological transformation on the image best created the outline of the shapes. However, due to little contrast in color between the embossings and the chips itself, it was challenging to highlight the key features of the model. Additionally, the wood grains of the desk in the background and even the layers of 3D-printed material added to noise to the image.</p>
            <p>Although character recognition is widely accessible, braille recognition remains somewhat unexplored. A paper from King Saud University outlines the image transformation steps that has yielded a more efficient recognition of braille cells[4]. The process involves first rotating the image to align the braille vertically and horizontally, detecting each dot, and then recognizing each cell. Each cell could be identified by segmenting then constructing lines in regular intervals according to a scale. The intersection of the dots and lines allow identification of each cell.</p>
            <p>Identifying each braille character requires another process. In a paper from the Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, such a system of optical recognition was proposed[5]. It would identify each column of braille dots, also known as as a half character. Though the paper recognizes room for further optimization, it claims that the current system achieves a 99% accuracy rate in recognition.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Though not used in the testing samples, the final physical model should use different colors for each set of pieces and chips to enhance recognition accuracy by computer vision. Furthermore, as the pieces were constructed from a combination of geometric shapes, pictures of the pieces need to be taken under different conditions to create a dataset train the program to recognize each one.</p>
