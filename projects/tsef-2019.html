                    <p>This is a blog of my Tidewater Science and Engineering Fair project, which I completed with a
                        partner during my junior year of high school.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In this project titled <i>Rocket Payload Separation to Achieve a Target Apogee</i>, we designed a
                        mechanical method of separation a rocket payload.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Technologies we used in this project include the Mojo 3D-printer, Arduino Nano, RockSim, and
                        Fritzing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In February of 2019, we presented this project at the Ocean Lakes Night of Science where we were
                        awarded the MSA Research Medallion. Later, in March of 2019, we competed at the Tidewater
                        Science and Engineering Fair and won a 1st place team special award from the Armed Forces
                        Communications & Electronics Association (AFCEA), Tidewater chapter.</p>

                    <p>One must account for many factors such as wind, drag force, and weight of the rocket in order to
                        design a rocket that will achieve the desired altitude (Benson, 2014). However, the constantly
                        changing conditions often lead to errors in predictions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To achieve a target apogee, we will develop a program that will autonomously control a mechanism
                        to separate the payload. The separation will increase the surface area, thus introducing more
                        drag (Hall, 2015). This will reduce upward motion and allow the rocket to reach the desired
                        altitude. Additionally, this system will allow a rocket to reach different target altitudes
                        without the need to redesign a new one. This project will test an innovative approach for
                        reaching a target apogee.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Can the payload of a model rocket be separated early to achieve an apogee closer to the target
                        altitude?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the rocketâ€™s payload separates prior to reaching the projected altitude, then the separation
                        will introduce more drag which will slow down the rocket so that it will reach an apogee closer
                        to the target altitude.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Due to the use of rocket motors and igniters, contingency plans have been developed and safety
                        precautions for each of these have been noted, as listed in the outlined material safety data
                        sheet.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Estes Model Rocket Engine must be stored in a cool, dry location to avoid possible
                        combustion. It must be protected against water and humidity. Any sources of ignition must be
                        kept away. When launching the model rocket, a deflection plate must be used due to fire and
                        projection hazards. In the event of a fire, it will be extinguished using normal procedures.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Our initial plan was to use a BBC Micro:bit as a circuit board, but we found that in order to use
                        the Micro:bit, many libraries would have to be imported to connect to the sensor and allow the
                        code to work. Despite its small size, it was also not small enough to fit inside the electronics
                        container. Due to these complications, we decided to use an Arduino Nano.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We also encountered issues with connecting the servos and altimeter to the Arduino Nano. Since
                        we did not have a lot of prior experience with electronics, our project supervisor provided us
                        with materials and assistance in figuring out where to place connections.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All the electronics and parts had to fit within a 56mm diameter area since the top section of the
                        rocket housed the electronics. The servo holder and electronics compartment were designed to be
                        very compact.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The center rack piece had to be held steady in order to keep separation consistent. In order to
                        do this, we had to reprint the servo holder and rack piece with grooves for better
                        alignment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since our rocket did not use a traditional design, in which the shock cord is attached to the
                        nose cone and the motor mount, we had to improvise by drilling holes into the electronics
                        container and the parachute container, and the shock cord was connected to those. The
                        electronics container was held inside the rocket by tying shock cord to the holes that were
                        drilled and a hole drilled into the upper end of the rocket. A piece from another model rocket
                        kit was then used to cover the hole in the rocket and keep the rocket relatively
                        aerodynamic.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <div id="results" class="subsection-head">
                        <h4>Results</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>We initially anticipated that our mechanism would cause consistent separation. We also expected
                        that it would allow us to reach an altitude closer to the target apogee. The whole mechanism did
                        work fairly reliably on the ground when the parachute was not inside the rocket.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, once the parachute was placed inside the rocket, the mechanism stuck to a cord, and this
                        lack of motion as the servos turned caused a gear to break off. Our conclusion is that by
                        increasing the size of the top section of the rocket and redesigning the electronics container
                        and the parachute container, the mechanism would work successfully and more consistently as a
                        result of the increased space to work in and better storage for cords and parachute shroud
                        lines.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once redesigned, this method of separation will provide rocketeers with another reliable way of
                        reaching target apogees.</p>
